Javascript Homework

app.js is the main program that processed data.js and appends the table to index.html. You will find app.js in both UFO-level-1 and UFO-level-2. UFO-level-1 should meet all criteria asked in the README assignment. I tested all the date and the table returns table based on user input. I have also created an if-else statement to ensure that if a date is not in data.js, then it will return a message for the user. There are some comments to within app.js to help explain the structure of my code.

UFO-level-2 is not complete. I was able to filter the data based on datetime and city. The program will also return a table if the user only provides input in 1 of the 2 form and will return the original table if both forms are blank. I now have the foundation to add more search forms to the application but did not have enough time to test and debug all the issues.
